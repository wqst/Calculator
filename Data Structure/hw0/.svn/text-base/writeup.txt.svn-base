Precisely a year ago, after I received the offer from University of Illinois, I had a hour-long conversation with a U of I alumnus who graduated with a degree of Engineering. His vivid description of the program have ever since kept me intrigued and interested in becoming a member of one of the most prestigious engineering programs in the nation. Despite the occasional doubts that I once had over myself, I still decided to give it a try, because I have always understood that engineering and computer science have been and still are changing the world in all disciplines.
With little understanding of computer programming, I took the CS125 course and to be honest, it is by far the most interesting course I have taken at all levels of my academic endeavor. To be more specific, the machine problems indeed provided me with huge challenges but as well guaranteed the joy and satisfaction of tackling real-life problems with just letters and punctuations. Programming used to sound distant to me, but I feel that I am pushing myself towards the magic of it step by step. Despite the frustrating time that I have spent debugging my program, the feeling of accomplishment was beyond anything that my previous experiences have ever granted me with. 
Instead of merely completing homework and understanding classroom materials, I believe sincerely that the purpose of studying engineering is for the sake of real-life applications. That is precisely why I took my CS196 course and threw myself into the team project with utmost enthusiasm. The campus map that we designed using html and Javascript could certainly help clear the confusions I once faced as a freshman on campus. With the help of my TA, the department advisor and my fellow classmates, I have built my strong confidence and desire to become a successful software engineer and I really hope that University of Illinois could be the place for me to fulfill this goal.
Since young, I have been picturing in my head all sorts of improvements over my daily encounters. Now, after months of exposures to computer programming, I understand better than ever that computer science is the catalyst pushing society forward. I desire a career that allows me to fully utilize what I learn to fulfill my endless imagination. The continuous bursts of imagination have been the driving force for social development and now they are the driving force, encouraging me to pursue my dream. Once again, I cherish the precious opportunity that University of Illinois has provided me with and I sincerely hope to be considered as a candidate for the Computer Science program. I am confident that this is the place I truly belong to.
